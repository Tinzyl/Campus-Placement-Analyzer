## **Introduction**
The **Campus Placement Analyzer** is a comprehensive project designed to analyze, visualize, and model campus placement data. The project identifies trends, predicts placement probabilities, and explores salary patterns for students across various academic and professional attributes.

## **Features**  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
- Distributions of salaries using `mean`, `median`, and `mode` imputation techniques.  
- Visualizations of categorical variables (e.g., gender, work experience, and specialization).  
- Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between attributes like SSC scores, degree type, and salary.  

✅ **Data Preprocessing:**  
- Handling missing values using various imputation strategies.  
- Scaling and encoding categorical variables.  

✅ **Machine Learning Models:**  
- Decision Trees for classifying placement status based on academic scores and work experience.  
- Ridge and Lasso regression for tuning salary prediction models.  

✅ **Model Evaluation:**  
- Confusion matrices and ROC curves for classification models.  
- Regression error metrics like MAE and RMSE for salary predictions.
